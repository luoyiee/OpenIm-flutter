### Issues :bookmark_tabs:

##### 1. Does it support multiple languages?

A: Support, follow the system language by default

##### 2. Which platforms are supported?

A: The demo currently supports android and ios.

##### 3. The debug of the android installation package can run, but the release starts with a white screen?

A: The release package of flutter is obfuscated by default. You can use the command: flutter build release --no -shrink. If this command is invalid, you can do the following

Add the following configuration to the release configuration configured in android/app/build.gradle

```
release {
    minifyEnabled false
    useProguard false
    shrinkResources false
}
```

##### 4. What should I do if the code must be confused?

A: Add the following rules to the obfuscation rules

```
-keep class io.openim.**{*;}
-keep class open_im_sdk.**{*;}
-keep class open_im_sdk_callback.**{*;}
```

##### 5. The android installation package cannot be installed on the emulator?

A: Because the Demo has removed some cpu architectures, if you want to run it on the emulator, please do the following:

Add in android/build.gradle configuration

```
ndk {
    abiFilters "armeabi-v7a",  "x86"
}
```

##### 6, ios run/build release package error

A: Please set the CPU architecture to arm64, and then operate as follows

- flutter clean
- flutter pub get
- cd ios
- rm -f Podfile.lock
- rm -rf Pods
- pod install
- Run Archive after connecting to the real device

##### 7. What is the minimum version number for ios to run?

A: 13.0

#### 8. Some developers encountered the following problems:
```
Could not build the precompiled application for the device.
Error (Xcode): Signing for "TOCropViewController-TOCropViewControllerBundle" requires a development team. Select a development team
in the Signing & Capabilities editor.

Error (Xcode): Signing for "DKImagePickerController-DKImagePickerController" requires a development team. Select a development team
in the Signing & Capabilities editor.

      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings['EXPANDED_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY'] = ""
        config.build_settings['CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED'] = "NO"
        config.build_settings['CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED'] = "NO"      end
